Tl;DR: It's late and I need to stop procrastinating because i can't fix it as quick as i wanted

Goals:
- Agent with multi-faceted personality [done]
- Include user specific memory [done]
- Ability to read all DJ specific channel messages as the LLM [done]
- Respond with gifs [done]
- Vision [not functional at this time]
- DJ capabilities [half done]
- TTS via voice channels [half done]
Current notes:
- I can't get CV to work because I'm a numpty
  
Bugs:
- AI loops from memory need a !memory_bust or equivalent command to inject a specific prompt to break context loops, alt fix: make the command dump some memory
- CV is traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaash and my name is Oscar, two peas in a tin pod bby
- Calls helper personality too often

Upcoming changes:
- CV IF I CAN RUB ENOUGH BRAINCELLS TOGETHER
- Regex patterns/post processing system to fine tune responses from annoying repetition
- Expand emoji library/move them to a new line
- Daily post mechanic
- DJ capabilities
- Voice
- Replace personality files with final text prompts vs the testing promtps
